We are aware of several accounts on Twitter that violate [Twitter's
Impersonation Policy][] by pretending to be the Syscoin project or
well-known individuals associated with Syscoin.  These accounts
have been known to spread false or misleading information about Syscoin
and its contributors.

If you see one of these accounts, you may [report it to Twitter][].  If
you are reporting an issue about the Syscoin project and Twitter
asks that you enter the project's official email address, please use:
contact<span style="display:none"></span>@syscoin

This appears to be an unfortunately common issue on Twitter that affects
many other projects and individuals as well, so we urge you to carefully
evaluate any posts you see on Twitter---and elsewhere---to determine
whether or not they truly came from the indicated sender.

It is especially important to be careful about posts that recommend you
take an action that could potentially compromise your Syscoin or your
computer, such as a suggestion that you download a newer version of
Syscoin software.  The latest version of Syscoin Core can always be
obtained from the [download page][], and for greater security you are
recommended to verify the binary integrity using PGP (see the [full node
guide][] for instructions).

The Syscoin project will never contact you to ask you to disclose
information from your Syscoin wallet, including your balance, addresses,
transactions, or private keys.  If you receive a security announcement
and aren't sure whether or not it is legitimate, you can safely shutdown
your Syscoin software to eliminate any immediate problems and give
yourself time to investigate.
