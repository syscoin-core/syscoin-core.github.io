# Local builds and Travis CI builds of the SyscoinCore.org website do
# not include the /bin directory holding Syscoin Core binaries, so this
# test extracts the local URLs from the download page and checks that
# they exist on the remote server.  Only the file's HTTP headers are
# downloaded, not the entire binaries.
#
# Often we prepare a release PR for the website before the binaries are
# uploaded.  It is expected that this test will fail in that case, and
# simply restarting the tests after the binaries have been uploaded
# should resolve the issue and allow a clean merge.
#
# If all URLs work: prints nothing, returns 0.
# If any URLs fail: prints an error for each problem URL, returns 1.
