assetallocationlock asset_guid "addressfrom" "txid" output_index ( "witness" )

Lock an asset allocation to a specific UTXO (txid/output). This is useful for things such as hashlock and CLTV type operations where script checks are done on UTXO prior to spending which extend to an assetallocationsend.

Arguments:
1. asset_guid      (numeric, required) Asset guid
2. addressfrom     (string, required) Address that owns this asset allocation
3. txid            (string, required) Transaction hash
4. output_index    (numeric, required) Output index inside the transaction output array
5. witness         (string, optional, default="") Witness address that will sign for web-of-trust notarization of this transaction

Result:
{
  "hex": "hexstring"       (string) the unsigned transaction hexstring.
}
