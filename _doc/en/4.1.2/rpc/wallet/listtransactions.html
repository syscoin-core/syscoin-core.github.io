                        with the specified label, or "*" to disable filtering and return all transactions.
2. count                (numeric, optional, default=10) The number of transactions to return
3. skip                 (numeric, optional, default=0) The number of transactions to skip
4. include_watchonly    (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')
